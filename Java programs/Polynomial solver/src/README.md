## linked allocation system to represent and manipulate polynomials
 
+ Read in a polynomial and store it in variable A, B, or C.
+ Output a polynomial using a form that clearly displays it.
+ Add two polynomials and store the result in R.
+ Subtract two polynomials and store the result in R.
+ Multiply two polynomials and store the result in R.
+ Evaluate a polynomial at some point.
+ Clear a polynomial.

# Input Format

+ set:set the values of coeffecients for a polynomial (exponents should be in desending order) given the name of polynomial (A,B,C) and the coeffecients as a linked list.
+ print: prints a polynomial in a readble format given its name.
+ add: adds two polynomials given their names.
+ sub: subtracts the first polynomial from he second given their names.
+ mult: multiplies two polynomials given their names.
+ clear: clears a polynomial given its name.
+ eval: evaluates a polynomial given its name. You should print "Error" in case you catch any exceptions (empty polynomial,ivalid operation,etc....)
